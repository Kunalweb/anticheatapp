## Points to remember while testing the app

1. First setup the backend by following instructions in this [repository](https://github.com/prathamesh-mutkure/anti-cheat-app-backend)
2. When testing on android emulator, if you get a connection error use `http://10.0.2.2:8000/` instead of `localhost`
3. iOS emulator doesn't support camera, this will give an error, use a real device to test AI features.
4. Allow **permissions** for camera and mic when asked.
6. Make sure the `BACKEND_URL` is appended with `/api`

## Instructions

3. Install flutter packages
   - `flutter pub get`
4. Generate store classes
   - `flutter packages pub run build_runner build`
5. Create a `.env` file and set the following variables
   -  `BACKEND_URL`
6. Connect your device or emulator and run the app
